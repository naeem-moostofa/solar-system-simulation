# Solar System Simulation

A dynamic solar system simulation where you can interact with planets and observe their motion based on Newton's law of universal gravitation.

## Features
- **Planet Management:**
  - Add, remove, and edit planets with custom properties like mass, position, and velocity.
- **Real-Time Simulation:**
  - Watch planets orbit and interact gravitationally in a visually engaging way.
- **Interactive Menus:**
  - Easy-to-use menus to manage the solar system and control the simulation.
- **Customizability:**
  - Configure planetary properties to experiment with different scenarios.

## Physics Behind the Simulation
This project uses **Newton's law of universal gravitation** to calculate the forces acting on each planet:
\[
F = G \frac{{m_1 \cdot m_2}}{{r^2}}
\]
Where:
- \( F \) is the gravitational force.
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant.
- \( m_1, m_2 \) are the masses of two planets.
- \( r \) is the distance between the centers of the two planets.

The simulation updates the velocities and positions of planets using numerical methods.

## How to Use

1. Open the project in IntelliJ.
2. Run the SolarSystemRunner Class.
3. When prompted to upload a file the files "solarSystem.csv" and "solarSystemAsteroid.csv" are included in the project.
4. Navigate the menus to manage planets.
5. To add a planet add the image to the images folder then navigate through the menus to add the planet.
